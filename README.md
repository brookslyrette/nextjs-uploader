## Environment variables

`UPLOADER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: An AWS access key used to write and read files on S3

`UPLOADER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: An AWS secret access key used to write and read files on S3

`UPLOADER_AWS_S3_BUCKET`: The name of the AWS bucket where files are written

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret token used to encrypt JWT.

`NEXTAUTH_URL`: The url the application is deployed on.

`CUSTOMER_PASSWORD`: The password for the customer account.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
